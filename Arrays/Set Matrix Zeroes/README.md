# Set Matrix Zeroes

## Problem Description

Given an m x n matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0. Do it in-place.

Example:

Input:
[
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,1]
]
Output:
[
  [1,0,1],
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1]
]

## Constraints

- A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
- A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
- Could you devise a constant space solution?
